1. Voltage Regulation Section (U2 - LM317T)
Components Involved:
U2: LM317T (Adjustable Voltage Regulator)

B1: DC power supply (6V)

R5: 1kΩ Resistor

Other passive components around U2

Function:
LM317T regulates the 6V input from B1 down to a stable lower voltage, adjustable using resistors.

The output from LM317 (pin 2) is fed to the 555 timer.

R5 and the resistor to ground from ADJ set the output voltage using the formula:

⏲️ 2. 555 Timer Section (U1 - NE555)
Components Involved:
U1: 555 Timer IC

R1: 1kΩ

R2: 10kΩ

RV1: 1kΩ Variable Resistor (Potentiometer)

C1: 10µF (Electrolytic Capacitor)

C2: 0.01µF (Small timing capacitor)

Wiring between pins 6, 2, 7, and 3

Function:
Configured in Astable mode — constantly oscillates between HIGH and LOW (produces a square wave at pin 3).

The frequency and duty cycle of the blinking can be adjusted using RV1.

Output at pin 3 drives LEDs.

💡 3. LED Indication Section
Components Involved:
D1: Red LED

D2: Green LED

R3 and R4: 220Ω resistors (current limiting)

Function:
D1 and D2 alternate blinking**, based on the output from the 555 timer.

Red LED (D1) and Green LED (D2) toggle with the square wave output from the timer — for visual indication of the timer’s activity.

🧠 Overall Working Explanation:
Power Source (6V) feeds into LM317, which regulates voltage down (say to ~5V or adjustable).

The regulated voltage powers a 555 Timer configured in astable mode, continuously generating a square wave.

The timer output (pin 3) alternately switches ON and OFF.

This output toggles two LEDs (Red and Green) to flash alternately, creating a blinking effect.

RV1 allows you to change the frequency of blinking (adjust speed).
